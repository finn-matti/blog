    <em>The following is out of date. The blog is based on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and hosted on [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). Read more [here](/blog/2025/01/26/micro-blog-migration/).</em>

This blog is a so-called micro.blog, meaning that it offers blogging features that integrate nicely with a timeline that is not dissimilar to Twitter. See [their homepage](https://micro.blog) and [their welcome page](https://welcome.micro.blog) for more info.

That's why you'll find a [Replies](/replies/) page in the navigation, that lists all my recent replies to other micro.bloggers. And it is also the reason, why some of my posts have comments from other micro.bloggers.

Being part of the micro.blog social timeline does not require a paid subscription, you could e.g. also [connect your Wordpress](https://help.micro.blog/t/setting-up-wordpress/88).

There are also other ways to connect with me: You could write me an email. Every post has a clickable mailto link that makes connecting via email as easy as possible.

You could also hop on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@matti) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/finn-matti.bsky.social) (although I prefer Mastodon). All my content is mirrored over there, which means you can reply to any and every post I have written and you can also easily initiate a conversation, if that tickles your fancy.
