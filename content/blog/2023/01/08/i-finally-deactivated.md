I finally deactivated my twitter account. Hadn't really used it in a long while, won't miss it either. It feels better to not support that terrible platform anymore.

I'm amazed how long it took to pull the trigger. Twitter had made me far longer unhappy than new leadership disaster. Before I was unhappy with the toxic culture on Twitter. But I guess reading [TwitterIsGoingGreat.com](https://twitterisgoinggreat.com) day in and out makes it crystal clear how outright damaging it would be to even just cross post my things over there.
