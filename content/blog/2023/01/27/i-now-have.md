I now have a Mastodon account at [@matti@social.lol](https://social.lol/@matti). I probably will end up mostly crossposting content from my Micro.blog there, but I will play it by ear.

It's kinda funny: I tried to write this blog post three times already. The first two times I was going to say, that I was not going to get a Mastodon account just because I wanted to try out [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/). But I guess being unable to publish said post was a sign (right?).

So yeah. I'm very excited about trying this new thing or _these new things_, really: Mastodon, Ivory and [OMG.lol](https://omg.lol).
