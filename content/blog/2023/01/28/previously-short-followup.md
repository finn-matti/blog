Short follow-up:

- [Sometime](https://sometime.irisationlab.com) has not worked out for me. I never got the hang of it. I think it's a good app, it just didn't click with me.
- [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com/) is used very lightly. I would want to use it more, but I believe doing is more important than organizing or even tracking the doing.
