A little thing I do, when critiquing societal issues: I try to say what I think is wrong - morally or otherwise - and then try to formulate it as a requirement: In my future society, as a citizen, I'd like X. This helps to stay constructive, I find. It also helps to formulate guidelines for my own actions.
