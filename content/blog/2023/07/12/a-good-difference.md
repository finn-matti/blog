A good difference to make when talking about generating code through ChatGPT: It is much more of a molding process, than a writing process. Or: Using a chatbot to generate code is managing a bot. Managing (or molding) are a different kind of expertise than writing/programming. But you need to know how to program to manage your bot well, because you need to validate its output.
