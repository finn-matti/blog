I can't get this out of my head: [mastodon.online/@virtualb...](https://mastodon.online/@virtualbri/110702150664776411)

Can't believe that at some point in my life I  wanted to live in the US. How fucked up are things over there, that they won't even respect unions anymore?

I'm happy to be living in Finland tbh, where unions and coops are actually very common.
