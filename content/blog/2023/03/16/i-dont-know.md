I don't know why, but I may have for the first time really understood how OmniFocus' repeating event functionality works. Amazing how much complexity they managed to cram into this feature. I can actually express all my recurring tasks in my task manager. _But:_ It almost certainly means that I'm stuck with OmniFocus, because no other app can do this.
