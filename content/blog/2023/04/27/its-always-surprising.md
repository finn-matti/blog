It's always surprising to me, even though it shouldn't anymore: Pretty thorny coding project problem because a dependency update/runtime configuration conflict led to an edge case relatively deep in the stack. Tests that never failed, failed all of a sudden with unclear Errors, nobody in the team knew anything and even the internet was pretty unhelpful.

Programming is a lesson in patience and perseverance sometimes.
