Survived the day pretty well, all things considered. Dentist appointment showed no holes in my teeth, exterminator came and went, Napu and me went for a nice 5km walk in a national park around here. I played around with my new steam deck. Talked to my business tripping partner on the phone for a couple of hours. Lots of stuff out of the ordinary for a Wednesday, not enough sleep the night before. I can still feel a low humming of anxiety in the body.
