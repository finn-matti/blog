>The style is different, fewer Vogue cover stories[...]

Wow.  This is a Finish professor of world politics [commenting](https://yle.fi/a/74-20025571) on the outgoing prime minister Sanna Marin (the question was about the different styles of leadership).

P.S.: I acknowledge the fact that it was very early in the morning and the prof is not a native speaker, but: casual sexism much?! And how is it that the national broadcaster Yle just lets this sit there, uncommented, but edited for clarity when compared to the podcast episode?
