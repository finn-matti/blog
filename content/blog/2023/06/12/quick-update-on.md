Quick update on [my Diablo IV enjoyment](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/06/11/first-impression-of.html): I don't have any. So I stopped playing and went back to DeadCells, which is so much more fun.

What was nice, though: I tried to use my Steam Deck as a little gaming PC and it worked like a charm (if a little slow: there were a lot of frame rate drops while playing Diablo IV through [Lutris](https://lutris.net)). No need for a [Steam Deck Dock](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/dock) either, since I have had a USB-C hub laying around and that's enough. This opens up some nice possibilities in terms of playing non-mac games for me.
