[From the faq page of the mouse config tool "logi options+"](https://www.logitech.com/en-eu/software/logi-options-plus.html#software-download):

>Why is it called Logi Options+? Do I have to pay for it?

>The ‘+’ stands for better design and user experience, with more features available over time. The app is free to use.

Always good if you have to explain that the new app is better designed and has an improved user experience, because it's not obvious to the user wtf the name even stands for…

P.S.: Just to be clear: This app is a piece of garbage and breaks frequently.
