Quick note about [the recent discussion](https://atp.fm/537) about pricing of apps on [@atpfm@mastodon.social](https://micro.blog/atpfm@mastodon.social):

I agree with almost everything that has been said by the hosts as regards to subscription pricing vs. "lifetime unlock". It's very obvious that it's a better model for developers. However I think it's important to point out, that it would not be - at least not immediately - in the best interest of potential customers to agree. Saving money is always great. Not having to worry about stuff like canceling subscriptions is always great. Psychology matters. Even if there is a second order argument to be made about the benefits of subscriptions for customers: Loss aversion is a real thing.

P.S.: I'm trying to get myself blogging again by doing some more posts in this style: Short comments or observations without lots of explanation and context. Let's see how that goes.
