[Previously.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/12/11/two-promising-new.html)

Two more promising apps:

I'm a big fan of noise and music apps and podcasts for focus and sleep. [Dark Noise 3](https://darknoise.app) is a great one that was new to me. Especially its Green Noise sound is very soothing to me.

[Sequel 2](https://www.getsequel.app) is probably the first media tracking app, that I am actually using (for a few weeks at least). It's easy to use and has just the right amount of bells and whistles. This works better for me than, say, Trakt.tv, because I don't need nor want the social network aspect and I do want to track more than just one type of media.

[Forward. (Sequel 2)](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/11/27/if-there-would.html)
