An opinion is not an explanation of said opinion. Nor is trying to find an explanation for a thing already an opinion. Explanations are not a threat. You are allowed to disagree with them. You are allowed to try to find an explanation and still disagree with the status quo. Wanting to understand what's going on doesn't make you an enemy.
