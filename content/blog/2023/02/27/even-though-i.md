Even though I want to use the services that [Omg.lol](https://omg.lol) provides, I struggle to do so.

I set up [a profile page](https://omg.lol/matti) now, but I feel like this should be a page reachable under my domain (I can probably set this up). I love the idea of a status.log, but I have a micro.blog already and all the content should come from that as the canonical place and be fed into other means to consume my content. I don't want to produce parallel content or keep things up to date manually.

I'll keep my omg.log address, because my mastodon account is registered on their instance, but I'm not sure what I'll use it for otherwise at the moment.

UPDATE: My profile page is now reachable [under my domain](https://martin-haehnel.de).
