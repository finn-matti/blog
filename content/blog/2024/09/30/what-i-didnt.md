What I didn't consider [when trying to write more posts originating from my blog](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/09/29/back-to-posting.html): What if I want to refer to another mastodon post? What if I want to create a little thread?

And how funny that this post even briefly appeared in my "Popular & Trendingâ€¦" tab in Ivory.
