Python really is almost on par with Javascript as regards to reinventing wheels.

Venn diagram taken from [this awesome overview of python tools](https://alpopkes.com/posts/python/packaging_tools/).

<img src="/media/uploads/2024/pipenv-updated-08-2024.png" alt="A venn diagram showing overlapping circles/categories going clockwise from the top: package management, python version management, package building, package publishing, environment management. In the diagram various tools are put within the circles. Pipenv is marked with a red circle, as it is the one that was talked about in the original context of the linked article. pipenv is located at the intersection of package management and environment management, whereas poetry is located at the intersection of package publishing environment management and package management." width="600" height="501" />
