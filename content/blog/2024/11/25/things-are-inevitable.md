"Things are inevitable and there is nothing you can do about it", is at the core of the [The Fatalistic Turn](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/31/hub-the-fatalistic.html). But the answer to this doesn't need to be acceptance. It just has to be an answer.

It could be "F**k You Optimism":

>We need this kind of radical hope now more than ever. Not because it will save us – no one is coming to save us – but because the alternative is paralysis. The systems want us to feel small, powerless, apathetic.
—[JA Westenberg](https://mastodon.social/@Daojoan/113540448146134959)

And another quote:

>Even when it feels futile. Especially then. Because in a collapsing world, defiant hope might be the only thing worth holding on to.
