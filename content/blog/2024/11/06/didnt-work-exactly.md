Didn't work exactly as I wanted (cc: [@matt@isfeeling.social](https://micro.blog/matt@isfeeling.social) any chance for square image templates?), but I do love the Stellaris soundtrack to make my mind be interested in something else then just what's happening right now. May want to give it a try if you own the game. Lots and lots of great scifi music (6 hours +).

Here's the review text: Great video game soundtrack to think about something else than what is happening in the news or politics right now. The cover image had the wrong aspect ratio to fit the template and is therefore cropped weirdly." width="600" height="352" />
