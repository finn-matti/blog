#buildinpublic #zknstuff I did it. Around 200 notes have been reviewed, filed away, linked to and from, some of them tagged, renamed, deleted (very few). Most of them were how-to notes, some were ideas, some were project journals, some just held some information like an address, a measurement, etc.
