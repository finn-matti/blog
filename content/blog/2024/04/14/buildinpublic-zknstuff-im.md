#buildinpublic #zknstuff I'm trying to figure out how to use these library Sundays the best at the moment and my idea was to use the [spaced repetition plugin](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) for it. I have done that a handful of weeks now but with so many notes it is kind of unsatisfying. So let's think about the review process a little, cleaning up what is there and maybe finding a new way to do things.
