One thing that always happens with this one: Don't know what the next step is. Learning goals are for now:

- phpstorm
- laravel
- tdd

So I use herd and dbngin for the local dev env and use phpstorm as the ide and realize that I have uncomitted stuff. Let's see if the tests pass.

#buildinpublic #mbsync
