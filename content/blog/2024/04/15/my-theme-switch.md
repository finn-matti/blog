My theme switch has lead to a couple of problems that I have to solve it seems in time I don't have. 1. posts without a title lead to links without one in the single post view <img src="uploads/2024/screenshot-2024-04-15-at-09.03.24.png" alt="An annotated screenshot ilustrating the invisible links problem" title="Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 09.03.24.png" border="0" width="598" height="269" /> 2. for some reason the categories view is not paged and you can't view posts in a category past the 11th post. Why? <img src="uploads/2024/category-pagination.png" alt="An annotated screenshot ilustrating the missing pagination in categories problem" title="category-pagination.png" border="0" width="599" height="366" /> Great. Great stuff.
