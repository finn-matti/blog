## Note

I today had a chance to say out loud a thought I've had for a while: It's sometimes easier to love something that is far away and maybe even unreachable. I have an easier time being German in Finland than I ever had in Germany. I love watching sports like baseball or ice hockey but do not like the thought of visiting a stadium. Most of the podcasts I listen to are from the US or Australia. I guess that the thing of affection being far away make it somehow easier to consume: its less likely to show its wrinkles and warts, either because I can't see them - because I'm not a native and therefore blissfully ignorant, especially if I'm physically far away also - or because I'm not living the day to day life embedded in a certain culture because of physical distance.
