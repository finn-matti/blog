The metrics that people in charge at my work care about the most seem(!; to me) to be not reached. It's true, I can be kind of slow but what I do is mostly thought through. It just takes time. Sometimes too much, I guess.

Amazing, how quickly confidence wanes under pressure. Tomorrow's another day.
