Where was I? Oh yes. Refactoring/Writing a test for the `markForSync` method. I have the starting point for the test, which creates a post using a factory and writes that same data to disk. Now we need to run the post through our method and see that the posts `sync_status` is not marked for creation/update/deletion.
