#buildinpublic #mbsync Discoverd another problem: I was allowing the categories field (json in the db) in my Post model to be null. Turns out if you do that you can't [cast that json to array](https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/laravel/cast-to-array-not-working) through eloquent. So I changed that in my migrations, but this means that the assumption you can write a post to the db with categories being null doesn't hold anymore. So more yak shavingâ€¦
