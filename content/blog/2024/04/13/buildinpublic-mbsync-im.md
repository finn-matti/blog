#buildinpublic #mbsync I'm much more familiar with codeception and my brain is kinda mushy so figuring out how to do things in PHPUnit took its time. However, I refactored that `storePost` method now and have a test (which I wrote first or at least started to write first) to make sure it does what I want it to do. Now back to `testMarkForSync`.
