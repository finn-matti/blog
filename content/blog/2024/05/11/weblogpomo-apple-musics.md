I do not have great needs when it comes to my music streaming service:

- I want (most) of the music that I know and love available to me
- I want to be able to manage owned music and want it to integrate with the streaming offering
- I want to be able to find new music that I actually like

I struggled especially with the last part until a few days ago, but I can now say, that **picking a song I like at the moment and use the create station command is pretty good**! It might be just my imagination, but I think that this generates better, more relevant song lists than using Autoplay when running out of music in a playlist, listening to the radio, or listening to their curated playlists (personalized or not). All of the other stuff doesn't really work for me. But this does. So it may be worth a try.
