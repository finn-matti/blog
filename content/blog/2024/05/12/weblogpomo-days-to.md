I need more reasons to blog regularly. Can we have a [WeblogPoMo](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024) every month? I have not been as engaged with my own blog in at least three months. It may not look like much, but I think that having an excuse to publish and work on the blog is awesome because the slight social pressure helps me build some momentum and get back to posting regularly. And then I noticed this sentence under "Inspiration" of the WeblogPoMo page:

>I am also (selfishly) prepping myself to get back into a daily blogging habit so I can complete Kev Quirk's 100 Days To Offload within the next year.

So what is [100 Day To Offload](https://100daystooffload.com)?

>The whole point of #100DaysToOffload is to challenge you to publish 100 posts on your personal blog in a year.

I guess I know what I'm doing next.
