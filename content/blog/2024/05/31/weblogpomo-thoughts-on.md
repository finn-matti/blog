I love [this post](https://louplummer.lol/post/i-like-your-blog-if) by Lou Plummer, especially this part spoke to me:

>**I like smart and smart-ass but not people who think themselves smarter than everyone else**
>There are a few bloggers who consistently write about how dumb people are and it's a big old turn off. I like smart people. I like people smarter than me (not hard). I even like people with a smart ass sense of humor but I have worked for too long with stereotypical computer support people who think all end users are stupid and I'm so very weary of that attitude. I think it's great to point out the misconceptions of others but it's boorish if that's the main thing someone writes about.

Maybe because I'm insanely self-conscious of what was my main output throughout the WeblogPoMo - mainly fatalistic and negative views on political change and some posts about an outburst of anger about a kind of naive take by my blog hoster on the whole OpenAI/Scarlett Johansson thing that I regret (my angry reply more than my more sober take later. I still think I have point, though), I also immediately thought: "for some people this could be me, maybeâ€¦".

Anyways. A great post that is well worth your time.
