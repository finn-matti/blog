## Note

See [Post Hubs](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/31/post-hubs.html) for an explanation of these kind of posts.

>All this is to say that: We will have to live with it. We will have to accept climate change. We won't be able to stop the catastrophe. All the displaced people. All the pain and suffering. All the biodiversity loss.
>
>What is interesting though, is that fossil fuels won't last forever and the world's overindulgence in a surplus of energy that is not bound to the solar energy system (as opposed to the fossil energy system that spurred much of industrialization) is inevitable. We will not live to see this, but we also won't stop the shit show until then. The planet will go through this. I don't see how it wouldn't.

- [The Fatalistic Turn](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/20/weblogpomo-the-fatalistic.html)
	- The main article for this topic. It tries to give some reasons why we won't stop climate change. At all.

The following are part of this thread in my thinking, either by being material for arguments within that main post or by using parts of that main post to argue in some way or another for or against something else.

- [Thoughts on “Manifesto for a Humane Web”](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/13/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html)
- [Vulnerable Thoughts Around LLMS and generative AI](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/14/weblogpomo-vulnerable-thoughts.html)
- [Is There A 3,5% Rule For The Web?](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/16/weblogpomo-ist-there.html)
- [A Rational Case For Protest](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/18/weblogpomo-a-rational.html)
- [Thoughts on “Takes spread like wildfire”](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/24/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html)
- [End of the myth of rational public discourse - The example of climate change](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/06/09/daystooffload-end-of.html)

An early example of my stance against hoping for large-scale change of society:

- [Problems of the Social or Properties of the Social](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2021/09/30/problems-of-the.html)

### Non-Acceptance Answers

#### Myth Making

It seems to me that one way forward is taking a longe duree view and invest into myth making:

- [An Updated Manifest Destiny - Or How Myth Making Might Intentionally Change The World After All (Comment on Andrew Dana Hudson's "Space is Dead. Why Do We Keep Writing About It?")](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/10/30/loved-this-one.html)

#### Fuck You Optimism

Another option is a kind of optimism that is being optimistic in a way that is defiant, mad and basically saying "oh yeah?! well fuck you, I'm gonna do this thing anyways!"

- [Another non-acceptance answer to the fatalistic turn: Fuck You Optimism](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/11/25/things-are-inevitable.html)

### Urgency Fallacy

I think because societal or even planetary change will come - if ever - only very slowly, that any insinuation that we have to act quickly and on a grand scale is an insult to me:

- ["[...]Activists of the alarmist school: There is no swift and holistic reform coming![...]"](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/11/22/will-discuss-our.html)
