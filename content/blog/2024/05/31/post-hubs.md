## Changelog

 - 2024-05-31 - Created this note
 - 2024-11-04 - Added "Maintenance Romanticism" Hub
 - 2025-01-27 - Added "Setup" Hub

## Note

A hub is a new idea of mine to resurface and connect my blog posts that more or less have something to do with a topic. I'll collect posts of mine - maybe posts of others? - that fit the topic of a hub.

In comparison to a category or tag, a hub allows for giving some commentary and is supposed to grow and change over time.
