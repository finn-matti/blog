Mastodon ([Adrianna Tan](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/113592514717552602)) made me aware of this today:

I cried watching this. mental health and compassion is so important. If you're not the one struggling today, maybe a loved one is. Transpose this, so you're compassionate towards others in this case.[^1]

[^1]: If you can! I know that this can also be hard. Here's the thing: Caring for others is also a care task. So similar wisdom applies: Make it work for you by being kind to yourself, also.

[KC Davis also has a Website.](https://www.strugglecare.com)

P.S.: The usual disclaimer about Ted talks applies: They are meant to make you emotional and the ideas shared may be less unique, less mind blowing, etc. than they seem at first. But that doesn't make this simple reminder and its particular spin on care tasks less important (IMHO). But take this in with an awareness of its framing.
