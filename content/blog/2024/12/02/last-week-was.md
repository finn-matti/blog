Last week was somehow very unproductive at work. I guess free time was somewhat more exhausting than usual. We had a guest over and cooking and cleanup took me much longer than usual. So I slept less, which in turn meant I couldn't concentrate, which meant I had to work longer, which meant cooking and clean-up took longer... rinse and repeat.

Although I slept badly on the weekend, too, I seem to have more brains so far.
