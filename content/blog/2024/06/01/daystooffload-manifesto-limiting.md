(Having recently ranted [against Manifestos](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/13/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html), I had a reason to formulate one of my own. I hope that this personal manifesto is more productive than something like the [Manifesto for a Humane Web](https://humanewebmanifesto.com) because it is only meant for me, actually includes the steps I'll take and doesn't need to scale in any way.)

So, let's just start with the obvious: I'm here to write and post dog pictures. I am a programmer with a background in the humanities. But I'm unable to devote real time to any side projects apart from writing here. So I made a decision. No more projects. Actually: Way less projects.

- [I had the idea to update my crossposting workflow](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/07/a-new-crossposting.html): that's not going to happen
- [I had the idea of developing my own blot.im inspired micro blog sync client](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/04/12/inspired-by-vincent.html): I am not going to pursue that any further
- I had the idea to develop a JavaScript-based DailyDogo viewing widget: I'm sorry, but it ain't happening either
- I am not going to create Newsletters, Websites, Blogs, Courses, Apps, Extensions, Plugins, CLI-Tools, Videos, Podcasts, Streams or anything else that could be considered content. I will write here and in my notes system. What I will do on my blog is my public persona on the web and what I will write privately will help me realize my potential. The important part is the writing. Not so much the design of the website. I will let the latter go.

**_I am going to write regularly in way that I find challenging and engaging. I will try to be vulnerable, I will try to not hide behind a veneer of safe agreeable stances and topics._**

I will try to limit and down-size non-public personal projects and ongoing areas of responsibility as well:

- I am not going to implement [a manual notes and hightlights reviewing workflow](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/04/14/buildinpublic-zknstuff-im.html): I just don't have time for that every week. I review what I review. Readwise saves the highlights I made to my notes system automatically. That ought to be enough.
- I am not going to commit to reading/listening to a certain amount of books this year: I read what I read.
- I am not going to track, measure, document, visualize, or overly plan my life anymore. My ToDo-List is simple. If I can't do what's on the list for the day without overwhelm, I will remove items until it has become manageable again).

**_I am going to continue to write in private, incorporating my love for the abstract and trying to develop ideas and coming up with ways to live the small, slow life in a world that is on fire and probably will stay on fire for the rest of my lifetime._**

I will try to embrace to do less things at work, too.

- I am not going to see every opportunity for change in the company in general as a must-participate for me.
- I am not going to let technical purity concerns block me from doing a good job.
- I am not going to say yes per default to every challenge to my estimations and ways in which I'm going to approach the task at hand either.
- I am not going to react immediately to any and every message in my work chat.
- I am not going to ignore my scheduled time blocks to do focussed work or anything else I had planned.

**_I am going to try to hone my craft, with an eye for quality, architecture and pragmatic professionalism. I am going to take advantage of the 4 hours per week that I am supposed to be able to use for learning and growing as a programmer._**
