See [Post Hubs](/2024/05/31/post-hubs.html) for an explanation of these kind of posts.

>The efficiency part is where my main problem lies: In order to deliver on time I will need to learn to cut corners and leave messy code as it is and even add my own mess on top of the rest at times.
>
>This doesn't seem to enable delivering greatness. After having read [Slow Productivity](/2024/06/05/daystooffload-review-cal.html) recently, that has a completely different philosophy about work - "do fewer things", "work at a natural pace", "obsess over quality" are its main points - this job stands at odds with this philosophy (that I am whole heartedly agree with).
>
>I now think that this is not the correct framing. It's reasonable to assume that I will work for the rest of my career in situations that demand - more or less - efficiency. "Delivering greatness", in part, is about making it happen under economic constraints. Entrepreneur or salaried worker: This means that I need to be a good investment to be allowed to work on whatever I deem "high quality greatness"™.

This post was a first attempt at framing the problem of being an ineffective programmer. Before this one, I wrote a very emotional one that was mostly fueled by fear of getting fired for taking too long at work:

>It sucks to admit, but I am pretty slow, when just measured on delivered features compared to many others. The main reason is that I am unable, maybe also unwilling, to "just deliver".

I am now trying to figure out what makes me inefficient and how I could become more efficient.

- [Difference Between Productivity And Efficiency](/2024/06/23/daystooffload-difference-between.html)


After two weeks sitting with the problem I think my framing of overcoming my own ineffectiveness is correct: I will not be able to escape it and it's good to challenge myself:
