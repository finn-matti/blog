Really!? UPS Finland sent me a message basically saying "Your shipment is comingâ€¦". I saw the notification, but didn't bother to open it. Why would I? Well I finally got around to reading the whole thing and it says (not their exact words): "Your shipment is coming. If you don't reply to us, we will drop off the package in some shop some distance away, instead of sending it to your original home address, where you're comfy and content and expect the package to come. Oh and do so before 4 p.m. Oh it's after 4 p.m.? Sucks to be you!"
