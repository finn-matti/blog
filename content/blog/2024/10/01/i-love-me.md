I LOVE me some small functions/methods. For work I am implementing a class that replaces occurrences of the [German "SZ" ÃŸ/áºž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F). Here are some of the methods:

- replaceSz
- includesSz
- includesSmallSz
- includesBigSz

Am I going too far? ðŸ˜… I feel that "mini methods" like these make code more understandable, because you only have to grok _either_ the implementations or the composed logical blocks, but not both at the same time. Also stack traces become better and debugging is easier.
