I'm probably in the minority, but I actually do like discord. I enjoy the more private community aspect that you get. That's perfect for something like podcasts, streamer communities, etc.

A valid point of criticism is that if you have information that ought to be discoverable using a search engine and/or has archival value, that it shouldn't be only available in these chat silos.

Still, I do appreciate the smaller scale and its semi-privateness quite a bit.
