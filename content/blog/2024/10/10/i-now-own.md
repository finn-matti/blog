I now own an anker 3-in-1 charger thingy and it's the first time in a long time that I have a "dock" for my phone. Love it! I love having a dedicated location for the phone (and the watch and my air podsâ€¦). Keeps the desk clean - or at least makes it easier to clean. And wireless charging is great, too. 5/5 would recommend.
