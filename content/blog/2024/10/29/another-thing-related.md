Another thing related to what I said about [loosing interest as soon as something has taken VC money](/2024/10/25/as-soon-as.html): If the pricing is not immediately obvious I also loose all interest. I'm rarely going to hunt for prices. If I do, I am more often than not disappointed. Case in point:

[godspeedapp.com](https://godspeedapp.com) I had to email them to learn about their one-time purchase option. And to nobody's surprise it was too expensive (I think it was like 200$ for two years of updates?).
