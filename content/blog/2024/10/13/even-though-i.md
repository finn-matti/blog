Even though I use it at times - we are kinda meant to at work; [see also my latest stance vis-a-vis this topic](/2024/08/11/the-way-we.html) - reading about AI and the gushing nonsensical optimism around it makes me so sad. I guess this is my stop? Is this where I'm supposed to be getting off this technological enthusiast train?
