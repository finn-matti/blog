[Gurman: Apple to Launch New M4 Macs and iPad Mini 7 on November 1](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/)

A new mini would be great. Here's hoping that a new mini also gets a keyboard case/stand. I'm not actually in the market for a new iPad (I have a mini and the smaller M1 pro), but when it's time I would want to go with a mini again.
