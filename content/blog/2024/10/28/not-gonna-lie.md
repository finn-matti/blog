Not gonna lie: In comparison to #node and #php the package and version management of python is pretty janky.

pipenv/pyenv makes it bearable, but it's still kind of a mess.

P.S: PHP's version management is bad, too. [PHPBrew](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew) is the best option. But since I use [Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/)/use a Container, it doesn't matter as much. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is great though.

P.P.S: You can get lost in the weeds with JS/TS package management, but just using npm or (my fav) [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for version management is rock solid.
