A streamer/Youtuber I watch for cozy vibes made a video about a very upsetting topic that leads almost directly to very upsetting further comments and posts by other people about the same topic. And I can't stop clicking around and hate-consuming that crap. It isn't even that they are wrong necessarily, but I really didn't want to be so upset at the end of the day... (This post is an attempt to make it stop)
