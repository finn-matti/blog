## Changelog

- 2025-01-29 - Added a link to make clear that it's possible to follow this blog through mastodon.
- 2025-01-30 - Linked the (now hidden from the navigation) Replies page, with a little explaination.

## Note

I have migrated my blog and with it, changed the template. This is a work-in-progress, so you'll find unfinished things and broken things.

If you do find a problem, please tell me!

- I'm on [mastodon](https://social.lol/@matti)
- I'm on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/finn-matti.bsky.social)
- You can also write me [an email](mailto:matti@omg.lol)

I plan to make the blog available to the mb timeline natively at some point again, until then you can follow my posts through mastodon with micro.blog. Check out [this post](https://help.micro.blog/t/mastodon-and-activitypub/95) in their help forums ("How can I find Mastodon users to follow on Micro.blog?").

### Where is the Micro.blog Replies Page?

All micro.blog hosted blogs come with a replies page that includes all the "replies" you made to other people on the micro.blog timeline ([more info](https://help.micro.blog/t/hosted-replies/66)). This page still exists [here](/replies/), but it is not implemented, yet. My goal is to at least keep my old mb replies around, but It'd be great to use this page for any and all replies made by me to other people on other socials. I'll have to see if I can figure out how to that. For now it's just an empty page though. One step at a time.
