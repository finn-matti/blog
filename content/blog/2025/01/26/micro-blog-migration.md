## Changelog

- 2025-01-29 - Added a link to make clear that it's possible to follow this blog through mastodon.

## Note

I have migrated my blog and with it, changed the template. This is a work-in-progress, so you'll find unfinished things and broken things.

If you do find a problem, please tell me!

- I'm on [mastodon](https://social.lol/@matti)
- I'm on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/finn-matti.bsky.social)
- You can also write me [an email](mailto:matti@omg.lol)

P.S.: I plan to make the blog available to the mb timeline natively at some point again, until then you can follow my posts through mastodon with micro.blog. Check out [this post](https://help.micro.blog/t/mastodon-and-activitypub/95) in their help forums ("How can I find Mastodon users to follow on Micro.blog?").
