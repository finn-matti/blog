## Changelog

- 2025-01-02 - Fixed a link and fixed a sentence in the Notes & Setup section

## Blog Post

*(I tried to do the year in review post a little differently this year, by using categories instead of the year and its month as its organizing principle. So it reads a little different in comparison to the years before, but I like this new format! Feels somehow more sustainable. Well, we'll see how I think about this next year...)*

### Health And Fitness

I feel like I said everything I wanted to say about sleep in my recap blog post about this: [Yearly Theme 2024 Recap - Year Of Sleep](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/12/07/yearly-theme-recap.html).

I tried to run a little (using [Watch To 5k](https://www.watchto5k.com), which I liked, but I somehow lost momentum in Week 3 of 9), but apart from walking the dog and doing the occasional day hike, I didn't to anything this year.

Mentally, I'm doing okay, but I have noticed that I am more nervous, sometimes anxious - maybe that's not a change that is specific to this year, but I have noticed it more this year. I am unsure what to make of it. I want to think that it is at least in part a positive thing, because I acknowledge those feelings more, but of course, being anxious is stressful. Anxiety triggers included: Money and job security, travel and expectations from others. The move from Kuusamo to Oulu - which I have not written about, it seems - was stressful. And in general this year had at times lots of overwhelm in store for me, where I had the feeling that my brain stopped working. I think this is burnout rearing its ugly head - I _think_ this may have had to do with my problems at work, but I feel like I got this back under control.

### Finances

I got back into budgeting this year. I wrote about it a little in [Shift to Europe](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/11/14/shift-to-europe.html#actual-in-ynab-out). So basically: I restarted with YNAB after a year or so of slacking off and switched to Actual in the third quarter and have been pretty happy with it.

### The Blog And Other Projects

Let's start with the side projects: I wrote a little manifesto about it: [Limiting Projects To Not Be Limited By Them](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/06/01/daystooffload-manifesto-limiting.html). Basically I came to the conclusion that apart from this blog I can't really afford any side projects, as I simply do not have the time or energy.

I have softened that stance a little and have allowed one (1) side project to exist while having a blog: 2024 has seen the death of three (or so) different side projects that were never announced. So in a sense, I do have an open slot here.

Also, I would in theory like to move my blog. The reasons are not so interesting. Mostly, I would like a little more control and would prefer a better (source code) editing experience. Also, I do not like Hugo as a static site generator. (And to a much lesser extent I am not 100% happy with my blog hoster w/r/t to their cavalier attitude towards AI - [although I have walked a lot of my initial anger back quite a bit](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/22/weblogpomo-by-association.html).)

I have made one stab so far to try to get an archive of my blog working with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and was relatively successful in a relatively short amount of time (4-6 hours or so?). The css was a little wrong and I am not sure that the URLs would be preserved, but we'll see what I can do about this migration project in 2025.

I did write more this year than in the years before, the [WeblogPoMo](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/11/weblogpomo-overview.html) and [100DaysToOffload](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/06/02/daystooffload-overview.html) surely helped, even though I abandoned the latter at some point.

### Work

Work was a mixed bag of anxiety and actually feeling pretty good about myself. Thankfully the "feeling good about myself" happened in the last third of this year, while I was very unsure about my whole situation in the middle of the year. The post hub [Efficient Programming](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/06/23/daystooffload-hub-efficient.html) and the post [Reflexions After Two Weeks Of Having Accepted My Ineffectiveness](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/07/04/daystooffload-reflexions-after.html) reveals in the way I named them how shaken I was at that time.

But, with a little perspective, I can say that:

1. Sure, I can and should look for ways to be more effective and I am a person who takes his time in general, so it's good to keep that in mind.
2. I am not a moron, though. Sometimes things take time because they take time. Or because taking time is beneficial and sometimes it's worth it to take more time and face the music for having done so, because it's worth it.

So, I think I am in a much better space now, again, and am looking forward to what I'll do next in my job.

### Media

I tend to consume less media - especially movies and series - than others, because I like to watch Youtube and/or play video games or do some other stuff on my computer. However, I did watch some movies that I like - like both parts of Dune, Fly Me To The Moon and some others. I also watched some Series like Mare Of Easttown and most recently Apple TV+'s Silo. 911 and its Texas-spinoff Lonestar are long term favorites of ours also.

I read (mostly through Kindle) and heard (mostly through Audible) some books, too. I liked Building A Second Brain, Slow Productivity - although I knew most of their contents already, it was nice to refresh these ideas -, Katherine May's Enchantment and Wintering - I did like Enchantment a lot more -, You Could Make This Place Beautiful by Maggie Smith, A Death In The Family bei Knåusgård and some work related stuff like Fundamentals Of Software Architecture. All of these had some value to them. I read/listened to more stuff, but not that much more. As always, I would've liked to consume more books.

I did spend many hours watching Youtube this year. Mostly [Baarlorlord](https://www.youtube.com/@Baalorlord) (Slay The Spire Twitch Streamer) and [Cracking The Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/@CrackingTheCryptic) (Sudoku-Channel). Everything else was watched _way_ less. [Jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/@Jorbs) (Twitch Streamer), [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/@aragusea) (Food), [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections) (How does a freeze dryer work? How about a coffee maker?), [MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd) (tech), [A Better Computer](https://www.youtube.com/@ABetterComputer) (apple tech) and some others. Most recently I have discovered [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal) (Productivity).

I played some games but finished few. My epic Baldur's Gate III play-through - 200 hours and counting - is still ongoing. My all time faves like Stellaris, Dead Cells and Slay The Spire ([STS2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttVtllHkb4E) was announced and I'm soooo looking forward to it) saw many hours of play. I did finish The [Case Of The Golden Idol](https://www.thegoldenidol.com), though, which was awesome. After BG III I'll probably check out its successor: [Rise Of The Golden Idol](https://www.riseofthegoldenidol.com//).

### LLMs and AI

My thinking has evolved around this topic, but it has not fundamentally changed, even though I tried hard to absorb even more AI criticism (like things from Emily M. Bender) - which is the standpoint that I feel intuitively is mostly correct. I have not changed my stance though that there are acceptable use cases. Which doesn't mean I don't care about the implications of using LLMs. Which in turn doesn't mean either, that it is taboo to use them. Many of us still drive a gas powered car (hopefully a small gas saving model), because having no car or even an electric one is often, depending on your specific context, untenable (it is in mine). I think we should think about LLMs similarly: We should use them when it makes a clear user verifiable case for itself. For example, LLMs are good Boilerplate+™ code generators: As it's easy enough to figure out - for me, since I am a developer - if, what the model generates, actually does what it should (and does it in a way it should, and does it in a way that does gel with the rest of the code, and doesn't introduce security problems, ...). I recently found the LLMs are okay at giving food ideas and replacements for foods, which is a new use case for them for me that I feel like I can verify pretty quickly and gauge correctly.

Anyways, my most complete take on the topic is this: [The Way We Use LLMs Makes All The Difference](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/08/11/the-way-we.html), which I still stand by.

### Real World Things

- I was in Berlin in January to meet my Mom and go to a couple of Handball games for the Men's European Handball Championship, which was awesome.
- We moved to Oulu from Kuusamo, after my partner lost her job (thanks right-wing government, I vow when and if I am allowed to vote in this country to never ever vote for you). Although there was a lot of despair, we made it through to the other side. The move was pretty stressful and exhausting, but it was right to do. I do love Oulu. But I will always miss Kussamo's nature and safety, my first "home" before moving to Finland will always have a special place in my heart.
- Our summer vacation was spent road tripping around and seeing some of the nature of Lake Finland. Especially our stay on the [Linnansaari](https://classic.nationalparks.fi/linnansaarinp) island was amazing. I wrote about our low-tech situation and how much I enjoyed it: [I thrive in a low-tech environment](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/07/13/daystooffload-i-thrive.html).
- My dad visited in September and stayed with us for 5 days. All of us in the same apartment. I was slightly nervous about it, because the dog is not used to having visitors, but also Napu has grown up a lot over the last year and it went amazingly.
- I am still surprised that I missed Bruno Latour's death in 2022. I wrote about it here: [Latour](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/11/05/latour.html).

There were other things, but these are the things I'd like to or at least want to remember.

### Notes & Setup

I had a PARA-System setup even before I read the Building A Second Brain book, but reading it shifted something and gradually my notes seem to fit - it's ongoing - a more compartmentalized approach more. So I have followed my feeling here and a big part of my recent note taking took part in the "resources" section of my PARA (sub)system.

I also payed for a - kinda medium quality, tbh - online course for the [time sector system](https://carl-pullein.thinkific.com/courses/the-time-sector-course): The idea here is to organize tasks not by project but by the time you intend to do them: This week, next week, this month, next month or long-term. Any and all project management is done in your notes system. This simplifies the decision making process a lot: You only need to answer _when_, which is why this system is also called a "when-based, not project-based system".

I found the idea very compelling, but in practice somewhat hard to stick to. But this was a problem that plagued me the whole year, really: To many damn changes without many results w/r/t my task management system. I went from [OmniFocus 4](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) to [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), from Things to [TickTick](https://www.ticktick.com), from TickTick to Things. And if I remember correctly, I tried [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com), [Todoist](https://todoist.com), [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com) and some others as well. I am back with Things now, but I feel that I am not yet done with my task management app and methodology dance: An important aspect of 2025 will be to find a sustainable way to integrate task and note management for real. [Due](https://www.dueapp.com) has been my rock for anything that had to get done, regardless of the current state of my task management system.

The [Obsidian Webclipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) was a great addition. I had initially no use case for it, since it is not a good replacement (yet) for a read-it-later service like [Readwise](https://readwise.io). But it's great to generate notes from a single (or a handful of highlights). Oh yeah: Omnivore died some short months after I migrated from Readwise Reader. But: [Readwise Reader is a pretty sweet tool](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/10/31/i-wont-lie.html), so I'm not that mad about it. And apropos Obsidian: This tool continues to delight me and is my "notes IDE" and is one of the most important tools in my arsenal.

I started journaling again by using [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com). I think I'll migrate this practice - any maybe the posts? - over to Obsidian though.

Somehow [this article about good books](https://aethermug.com/posts/you-don-t-have-time) and how to approach reading and [this app](https://one-sec.app) that delays braindead social media scrolling and similar things - both found at the end of the year - really helped using my time to do more higher value things like reading and listening to audio books.

And shortly after the US-election I wrote an article about my [Shift To Europe](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/11/14/shift-to-europe.html), in which I tried to lay out why I think it is important and correct as a European to prefer European software (and hardware). As an individual I think it is important and correct to prefer solutions that respect users, their privacy and their values. This may include non-European hard- and software. In practice this is still kind of wishy-washy, but it still helped to clarify my own thinking with regards to this topic and future technology choices.
