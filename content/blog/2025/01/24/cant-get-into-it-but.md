Can't get into it, but it's [not enough](https://notes.neatnik.net/2025/01/not-enough).

The AI stuff. The lgbtq+ stuff.

The AI stuff that was mostly about believing a woman and the not recognizing the smoke (for me).

Me trying to stay nuanced while people using "nuance" to hide their beliefs.

The lgbtq stuff that was mostly about not stating, clearly, your values and the actions you'd and -'ll take.

Sometimes things are outrageous.

Calm is not the same as right.

Being wrong a little about the topic and then being wrong a lot about other people's reasons.

And their feelings.

It all sucks.

You think 8 years is long? Try a lifetime.

Try saying "My values are" and "I support".

Then we'll talk. Or would have.
