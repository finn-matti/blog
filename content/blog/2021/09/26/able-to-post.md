My playing around with custom themes led to errors in the building of my site. Haven't been able to post at all because of this for five days or so.

I published two bigger posts:

- [A photo post about our little boat trip in Oulanka National Park](/2021/09/22/a-little-boat.html)
- [A little post about my eternal puppy fever](/2021/09/23/puppy-fever.html) - includes a photo of the family dog I spent my teens with: Lucy

Uff. What a relief to be able to post again (now for real).
