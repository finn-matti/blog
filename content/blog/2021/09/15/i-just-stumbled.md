I just stumbled upon this, while scrolling through the iPhone 13 pages on Apple's website: [The Plan to Protect Indigenous Elders Living Under the Northern Lights](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/11/world/canada/yellowknife-covid-northwest-territories.html)

Beautiful presentation. Makes me inspired.
