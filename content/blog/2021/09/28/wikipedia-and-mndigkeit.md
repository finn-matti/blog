I am amazed that one of the most important, if not the single most important term in continental and especially German idealistic enlightened philosophy, "Mündigkeit" (maturity), has only [a very short article](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mündigkeit_(Philosophie)) on the German Wikipedia (no discussion page that would explain this either) and no article in English. The only other Wikipedia with an article on it is the Danish one.
