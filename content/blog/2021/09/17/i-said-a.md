I said [a while ago](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2021/07/26/switched-over-today.html) that my GF and I switched from Youtube Music to Apple Music. While she is back with YTM, I'm enjoying Apple Music a lot more. I am working from home, though, listening to music through my laptop, while she has to deal with a lot more different environs.
