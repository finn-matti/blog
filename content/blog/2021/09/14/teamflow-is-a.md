[Teamflow](https://www.teamflowhq.com/?ref=landingfolio) is a kind of virtual office, in which every worker has a "video" bubble, that others can interact with. This seems like a surveilance tool to me. But trust and management are polar oposites.

I wonder if [@baldur](https://micro.blog/baldur) has a take on stuff like this?
