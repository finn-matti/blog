What a beautiful day! I had taken a vacation day from work today.

After I woke up to help my GF in the morning by preparing food and coffee for her, I crawled back to bed and slept in.

Took my sweet time, dreamt crazy dreams. Later, I started a new audio book from libby (more on that maybe another time) and started cleaning and stowing away our camping supplies.

In the evening we went out to that bar that is so close to us â€” they had an open terrace for us to sit on, drink beers and eat. Lazy discussions about our summer plans and how we would approach tomorrow's day hike.

Finally, a little stroll along the two lakes that are less than two hundred meters from our home.
