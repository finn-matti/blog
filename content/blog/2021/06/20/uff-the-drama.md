Uff. The drama around the roof reconstruction continues. They decided to work on Sunday, too. Drilling big hooks into the outer wall to secure the scaffolding. We were never warned about that our weekends would be ruined, too.

So thankful to my partner for calling the guy in charge and negotiating a stop - however she managed to do that. This is the least communicated reconstruction project I had to endure ever.
