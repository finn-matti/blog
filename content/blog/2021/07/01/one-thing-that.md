One thing that will be tricky for me is that I‘m no native English speaker. And although for most things that I might post here, being able to express myself is enough… It is not enough when considering writing in an essayist style as I like to do in German.

Maybe I have to mix posts? Use categories? Or keep it simply simple by sticking to English on this platform? Hm. (A second account would be a costly non-alternative for me, btw.)
