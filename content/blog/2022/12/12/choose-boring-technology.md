[Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) by Dan McKinley is a great example of a kind of thought I enjoy. Boredom (in technology but I suspect also otherwise) is almost always a good thing.

A while ago on another blog of mine and while still using Evernote for all my notes I wrote [an article about the benefits of using apps that are boring to you by now](https://noniin.antville.org/stories/2289504/):

>In most cases all of us have certain apps already in place for certain use cases. The idea here is to keep using the app and asking yourself if whatever is missing, is actually missing and then think about a change you actually would like to introduce to the current productivity system as a refactoring.
