Christmas is just hard on me. Every year I feel I have to steel myself, get ready for battle. I am not alone in this. I wonder what a calm and relaxed Christmas even would look like.

In any case: I'm trying to stay empathetic (or sympathetic if I can't put myself in the other's shoes), forgiving and try to get skillfully through the hell that is the last part of the year. As best as I can, I try to not make it about me and my introvert tendencies. This time is a gift for others.

But between us: I'm already looking forward to January, tbh.
