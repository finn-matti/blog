Does anybody have tips for good flannel shirts? I love the [monochrome ones from Patagonia](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-long-sleeved-organic-cotton-midweight-fjord-flannel-shirt/42400.html) (this year they don't have a model that is monochrome), but maybe someone has a brand they love that I don't know about?
