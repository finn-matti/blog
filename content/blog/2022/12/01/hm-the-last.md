Hm. The last [@atpfm@mastodon.social](https://micro.blog/atpfm@mastodon.social)  makes me think that having a dedicated mastodon account so I could use tapbots' client when it's out makes sense. It's probably not gonna support micro.blog. Or could it? [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton) [@ivory@tapbots.social](https://micro.blog/ivory@tapbots.social)
