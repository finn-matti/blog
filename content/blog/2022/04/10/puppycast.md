Special, extra unprepared edition! We finished up puppy school this week. Little progress on the potty training front. Little dog training in general. Longer walks. And a little more about anger (ego depletion).

I said I’ll try to keep it under 10 minutes , it ended up being about 15. Still better than 20+ minutes.
