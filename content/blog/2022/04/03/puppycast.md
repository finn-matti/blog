Napu‘s potty training is going well. Carpet shewing. Realities of being a dog owner. Not enough time to exercise at times. There are times when unwanted behaviors occur but training is not possible. (Still) Getting angry sometimes and how to think about that.

Apologies are in order: for the episode being late, its length and the wind noises. 🍃
