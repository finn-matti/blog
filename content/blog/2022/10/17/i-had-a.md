I had a fantastic day at work today. I guess I love programming? Found a way better solution to a problem I had hit my head against for a couple of weeks. The new solution (which I found while enjoying sitting in the sauna) requires less code, is also conceptually easier to understand and can be reused and adapted in the future if needed.
