<p><a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/06/07/thoughts-on-the.html">Previously</a></p>
<p>After using my new M1 Mac Book Air and my new 11" iPad Pro for some months now, I'm able to judge a little better how I use these machines:</p>
<p>First things first: The Air is the main machine. Wether it is note taking or coding, gaming or just watching youtube: I really like to use my Mac more than I like my iPad. The iPad is strictly better for cooking and is used frequently for that, but I have not used the machine to its full potential. I have noticed that I'm a very stationary person and like my current desk setup (private laptop on the left, KVM-enabled Display in the middle, work laptop on the right, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a> as my keyboard and Logitech MX Master 3 as my mouse), which doesn't include a real place for an iPad. I rarely work on the kitchen table - the only other spot really usable for writing/sitting down to do computer things in my home.Â Even when I'm traveling it's the laptop not the tablet that gets used.</p>
<p>That being said I'm happy about owning an iPad Pro, too. I use it frequently enough to make it worth the purchase, even if I'm a light user of it. Next time around I probably would get a cheaper, more basic model. The Air is just plainly a great computer and I can't even conceive a justification for wanting more out of a private computer (which gets used for 1 to 8 hours a day, depending on if it's the weekend or free time after work).</p>
