If there would be a bookshelves feature for games then the "currently playing" shelf would include [Dead Cells](https://dead-cells.com/). Bought it on a whim the other day, I have been playing it the whole weekend on my MacBook Air through steam using my xbox one controller. Easy to pick up, hard to put down.
