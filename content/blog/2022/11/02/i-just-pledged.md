I just pledged 210$ for a cooperative board game that I might never play: It's [the board game version of Slay The Spire](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/contentiongames/slay-the-spire-the-board-game), maybe the only game I put as much hours into as Diablo 2 back in the day, which tells a lot. (Stellaris is a distant third, which also tells a lot).
