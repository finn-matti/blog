It was naive to think that the economic situation would not make a meaningful difference. I am prepared for a hard winter. But it might, it _will_ get harder. As Ingeborg Bachmann so aptly said: ["Es kommen h√§rtere Tage"](https://www.lyrikline.org/de/gedichte/die-gestundete-zeit-264) (There will be harder days).
