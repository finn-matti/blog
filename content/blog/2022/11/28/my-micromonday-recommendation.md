My MicroMonday recommendation this week goes to [@annahavron](https://micro.blog/annahavron): A thoughtful productivity geek, that writes so interestingly (not only) about [paper-based productivity](https://analogoffice.net) that it's a joy to read even for someone who is not even using paper to organize their own life.
