twitterisgoinggreat.com finally took over the autocomplete spot of twitter itself. I'm not sad for twitter as a platform. It seemed like an attempt in solving an unsolvable moderation problem (that is: you can't solve moderation, you can only manage it).

But it makes me sad and angry how employees are treated. I hate that we live in the era of the billionaire. And I feel weirdly proud of being a European citizen in which this shit could've never happened in this way.
