No Podcast Episodes are being recorded at the moment as you probably have noticed. The reason is that wavelength, the podcast recording app for my blog hoster Micro.Blog seems to have problems. I tried to work around it by using the api directly, but it didn’t work and I didn’t have the time to look into it more. I hope this will be resolved soon and I can go back to record the early riser and puppy cast episodes again.
