<p>I had toyed with the idea for a while now: I have joined the ranks of the people who have their own newsletter!</p>
<p>Mine is called <a href="https://buttondown.email/notes-on-notes">Notes On Notes</a> and it collects and comments on a handful of links about notes and note taking that I found interesting in the last little while.</p>
<p>The thing is free and the first issue will go out tomorrow. I would be super thrilled if youâ€˜d <a href="https://buttondown.email/notes-on-notes">sign up</a>.</p>
