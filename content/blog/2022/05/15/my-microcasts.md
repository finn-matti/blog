<p>At the moment I publish three different microcasts (short, no-frills, solo podcasts):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/">The Early Riser</a> - daily, around 2 minutes about sleep, waking up early and related things - <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/feed.xml">Feed URL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/puppycast/">The PuppyCast</a> - weekly on weekends, around 10 minutes about my dog napu, training her, how she is growing up, etc. - <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/puppycast/feed.xml">Feed URL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/leaddev/">LeadDev</a> - whenever, my newest project, maybe 5 minutes (or a lot more) about my work and how I approach journeying towards maybe becoming a lead developer at some point in the future. - <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/leaddev/feed.xml">Feed URL</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I love microcasts because I don't always have the time to write posts. But since I'm frequently walking the dog, I do have the time to record something. I love to reflect about my life, my goals and ideas and this is the perfect outlet for it.</p>
