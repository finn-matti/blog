Any problems you may have in a particular area of your life are the result of the system that produces these.

I donâ€™t think I managed to talk about it eloquently, but what I tried to say: This is an interesting perspective, however you might not be in complete control of the system that produces problems. So you may have to satisfice and maybe even accept some things as realities that may have looked like solvable problems at first.
