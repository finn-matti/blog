<p>In January I did a yearly Review and planning session, a thing I always try to do every year.</p>

<p>This year I have the following goals and ideas which I'd like to try out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Becoming an early riser - Status Quo: Big success! So much more time<sup><a href="#fn1-22434" id="fnr1-22434" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to do my projects. Se also my unter two minutes podcast <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/">"The Early Riser"</a> that I record every single morning right after I have woken up.</li>
<li>"I will start" - Explanation: Be the one who initiates communication, anticipate things to do before anybody has to bring them up - Status: Eh. Could be better, but I am not so bothered by this.</li>
<li>Evidence-based living - Explanation: <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/19/080216.html">Track things</a> and find metrics to make more informed decisions about different areas in my life.</li>
<li>"Commit" - Explanation: Inspired by <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books">4000 Weeks</a>, I'll try to commit to only three work-in-progress items at a time and if I'm committed try to bring those things to an end that is satisfactory while also resisting other demands - internally or externally - on me and my time and attention. Status: Okay, actually.</li>
<li>"Read and Write more" - Status: Meh. I am trying, though. I found that playing around with <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a><sup><a href="#fn2-22434" id="fnr2-22434" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup> has motivated me to do more in this regard.</li>
</ul>

<p>A day has only 24 Hours, so how is changing the start of the day making a difference? It's all about not snoozing and using time in bed effectively. If you need 10 hours in bed to get 6 hours of sleep that's not very effective. On the other hand: If you sleep 7 hours while laying in bed for 8 that's pretty good. Changing my sleep schedule made me a more effective sleeper. <a href="#fnr1-22434" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">↩︎</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn2-22434">
<p>I can't decide if it's a great thing or overpriced, yet. [EDIT: <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/13/my-current-highlighting.html">I have decided that I like it. A lot.</a>] But I have noticed the little boost of interest of doing more reading (and re-reading) with every resurfaced highlight. So maybe it'll end up being worth it. <a href="#fnr2-22434" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">↩︎</a></p>
