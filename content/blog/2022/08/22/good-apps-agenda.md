<p>For a while I used <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/27/good-apps-obsidian.html">Obsidian</a> to contain all kinds of notes I take: <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/07/18/the-three-types.html">timeless notes, project notes and journal notes</a>. Now that I have discovered <a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a> I keep my project and journal notes there instead.</p>
<p>Agenda is great for notes, that are transitory in nature. I am a person who needs a writing surface to think and Agenda makes it easy to keep a somewhat ordered writing environment. One thing I really like about it: It makes it very easy to keep periodic notes, <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/08/22/stock-is-better.html">without me having to maintain a custom system</a>.</p>

EDIT: [I'm back with Obsidian for my journal notes.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/09/22/after-three-months.html)
