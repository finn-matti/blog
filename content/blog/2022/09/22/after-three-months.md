<p>After three months with <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/08/22/good-apps-agenda.html">Agenda</a>, which is still a very good app, I’m back with <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/27/good-apps-obsidian.html">Obsidian</a> for <a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/07/18/the-three-types.html">all the types of notes that I take</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/08/22/stock-is-better.html">I sang the praises</a> of not having to maintain my setup and instead use apps in the most default way possible recently: Let others deal with the maintenance of the features and use the provided way of doing things, instead of figuring everything out on my own.</p>
<p>This sounds good, however, I discovered I had to use a lot of energy to keep things that are important to me going.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking durable notes about my work almost didn’t happen anymore</li>
<li>Writing up what had happened during the week by distilling down my daily notes became too much of a chore</li>
<li>Taking notes on read materials, let alone reading challenging materials, just didn’t happen as much</li>
</ul>
<p>In hindsight, I also noticed that my posts about what apps to use and how to use them were a symptom of the necessity of constantly having to reframe my approach to be okay with not switching back to Obsidian.</p>
<p>To switch from one app for journaling to another for more serious note taking proofed to be too big of a context switch as well. I didn’t “live” in my notes as much as I like to do.</p>
<p>Another big reason for being fine with paying the price of maintaining things myself is the recent development of Obsidian: it now supports multiple windows, something that Agenda lacks and something that makes distilling a bunch of notes into a new one pretty hard.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that working on plugins for Obsidian is a way to lessen the load of maintenance and - since I’m a developer - a way to actually gain some expertise. So in my case, it is not a terrible investment of time and effort.</p>
