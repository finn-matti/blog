[Daytum](https://daytum.com) is a simple web app to track all the little things in your life. Think of it as an app that lets you create counters that can be named, categorized and - if you are a plus member - specified by using attributes. Finally they can be displayed in a variety of ways. An example: I track my dog's pees and poops in Daytum. The items are called pees and poops respectively. The category for both of them is dog in this case. And each have an entry attribute - to be filled - every time you add an entry, called: where, which has two options (inside and outside). Here is a couple of example displays for the last day:

The plus membership is dirt cheap: Only USD18 a year. The best thing is that Daytum also has a full-featured iPhone app, which makes entering new data super easy.
