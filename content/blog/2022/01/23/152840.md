[Writing](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/notes-on-notes.html) notes and [connecting](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/103518.html) them is a practice of incremental improvement. You start with something and turn it into something better over time.

In order to do this, you have to [be interested](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/104912.html) in what you are doing. You will also notice how the definition of "better" is likely to [change with time](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/110655.html). In this sense having a notes system won't lead to perfection. But it will lead to improvement.
