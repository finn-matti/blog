There will be ebbs and flows. As you change, your note taking practice is likely to change. Some things might fall into disrepair. Others become important. Your note taking system might fall dormant for a while. It happens.

Is this good? Bad? Otherwise? Reflect upon [why](https://micro.blog/account/posts/44388/edit/1492430) you want to do it, if evidence tells a different story. Be kind.
