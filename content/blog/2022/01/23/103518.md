In order to connect notes you first have to [write them](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/notes-on-notes.html). If you have notes you can start to link them.[^1] Why linking? [Why](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/104912.html) indeed! Have a reason. Maybe you have concepts that are connected in some way? Maybe you track gift ideas for the different people in your life and need an overview? Maybe you have a journal and you'd like to link yesterday's page with today's page and today's page with tomorrow's page?

Connecting notes helps to organize and structure your notes in a way that only ever requires a "local fit". In comparison to tags/categories that have to work for the whole of your notes, a link only needs to make sense for the linking note.

If it is not obvious why the link exists, make the reason explicit. You want to explain links more often than you might think.

[^1]: Writing a new note can include writing links to other notes.
