Found a way to run the old hugo version 0.54.0 locally (thanks to [this asdf version manager plugin](https://github.com/NeoHsu/asdf-hugo)) to see if the highlight shortcode works in principle with this version AND IT TOTALLY DOES! In other words: That syntax highlighting is broken is a problem of micro.blog, not Hugo.
