Have to say that I really enjoy the xbox experience a lot. The whole idea of a gaming console on which the games that are produced for it just work is amazing.

The game pass is great for players like me, too. If my xbox one doesnâ€™t cut it anymore I would not hesitate to get me an xbox series s.

The whole experience of playing games on consoles is very frictionless. Something that a time constrained man like me appreciates a lot.
