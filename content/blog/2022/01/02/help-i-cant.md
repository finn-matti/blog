.[@help](https://micro.blog/help) I can't seem to find [this post](/replies/2022/01/01/12326357.html) to add a picture. That the pic is missing, could that be related to [that upload problem with the mac app](/2022/01/02/help-adding-a.html) I mentioned? Or is it just that replies can't have pics/can't be edited (why?)? Didn't I make it a post by starting it with a dot?
