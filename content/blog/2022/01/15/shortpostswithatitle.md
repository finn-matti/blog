One kind of blog post that I really like is a short post with a title. One or two paragraphs about a topic (almost any topic really) is a great length for me. A title makes sure that it's going to be a somewhat framed thought.

A short post with a title can contain a picture or two to illustrate what's going on. It could have links or a video embed. I would really like to write more posts of this kind myself.
