.[@manton](https://micro.blog/manton) The design/template UI workflow is really not that good. Instead of using a two column layout which includes the editor and the preview it would be enormously better if it would be a three column layout so I wouldn't need to click back and choose a different file all the time, click forward to edit and preview it. Especially because often times different files interact with each other. The way it is now, is just not ergonomic at all.
