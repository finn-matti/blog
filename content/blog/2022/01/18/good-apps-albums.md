[Albums](https://www.albumstheapp.com) is a music app for iOS that will use your Apple Music library and is focused on playing full albums. Why is this great? Apart from being a joy to use, listening to full albums instead of just a song from this album and then that album, contextualizes the experience of the song. A bigger "unit of music" means less choices to make (either for me or an AI): And having to make less choices is a good thing for me.

Albums has many interesting features like an upcoming release feed and tools to rediscover albums you haven't listened to in a while. The app either requires a subscription or a one-time unlock which cost here around 25â‚¬. Instabuy for me.
